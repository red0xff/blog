The finals were held at NYUAD (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE), from November 6th to November 9th 2019.

Top 10 undergraduate teams from the qualification CTF (which was held in September) were invited to the finals.

I played with `Sudo_root`, and we finished on the 2nd place.

# HITB Cyberweek 2019

The event was held from October 14th to October 18th, at the Emirates Palace at Abu Dhabi.

We were invited to participate in the [Standoff](https://www.phdays.com/en/press/news/the-standoff-recap-and-highlights-of-live-cyberbattle-at-hitb-cyberweek-2019/), the contest was about doing penetration testing in a fictional industrial city, spanning about 17 square meters (183 square feet) and containing thousands of figurines. Over 100 meters (328 feet) of miniature railway tracks and more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) of wiring went into creating the city infrastructure. The mock city model allowed demonstrating consequences of real cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
