# CSAW'19 CTF Finals

The finals were held at [NYUAD (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE)](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/), from November 6th to November 9th 2019.

Top 10 undergraduate teams from the qualification CTF (which was held in September) were invited to the finals.

I played with `Sudo_root`, and we finished on the 2nd place.
