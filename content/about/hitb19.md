The event was held from October 14th to October 18th, at the [Emirates Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Palace) at Abu Dhabi, UAE.

We were invited to participate in the [Standoff](https://www.phdays.com/en/press/news/the-standoff-recap-and-highlights-of-live-cyberbattle-at-hitb-cyberweek-2019/), the contest was about doing penetration testing in a fictional industrial city, spanning about 17 square meters (183 square feet) and containing thousands of figurines. The mock city model allowed demonstrating consequences of real cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
